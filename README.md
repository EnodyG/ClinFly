## Introduction

A key challenge in precision medicine (PM) is to share clinical information between hospitals, especially using different languages.  
Moreover, in a world mainly composed of non-English speakers, most tools used for PM and genome sequencing analysis are only English-compatible. 

To leverage PM accessibility and data sharing, we developped an automated framework to anonymize, translate and summarize French-to-English clinical reports using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms which is compliant with medical standards of data privacy.
